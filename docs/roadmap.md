# Roadmap

Vue Query Builder is still in an early phase. Here are some things that are on the roadmap:

Immediate:
- Migrate to slots & scoped slots to allow more user control over layout
- Migrate from the `updateQuery` event to using `v-model`

Ongoing / long-term:
- Write unit and integration tests
- Allow reordering of rules and groups (possibly via drag and drop)
- Investigate and improve accessibility
